# ZoionNET: Low-Power Animal Intrusion Detection System

## Project Overview

ZoionNET is an innovative cellular-based solution designed to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts in the Methagiri Forest region of Tamil Nadu, India. The system addresses the critical challenge of animal intrusions that threaten both human lives and wildlife conservation.

## Key Features

- **Acoustic and Seismic Detection**: Uses advanced sensors to capture animal vocalizations and movement patterns
- **Deep Learning Classification**: Employs a CNN-based classifier to identify animal species with high accuracy
- **Low-Power Embedded System**: Utilizes a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) for efficient, energy-conscious operation
- **Real-Time Alerting**: Provides immediate notifications to forest rangers and local authorities

## Technical Highlights

- **Core Technologies**:
  - Arm Ethos U55 MicroNPU
  - YOLOv8 Deep Learning Model
  - Blues Swan V3 Microcontroller
  - Cellular Communication via Blues Notecard

- **Detection Capabilities**:
  - Focuses on high-risk animals: Elephants, Cheetahs, and Monkeys
  - Dual-state model (dormant/active) for power efficiency
  - Classification accuracy over 94%

## Social Impact

- Protects 8,000 people in nearby villages
- Helps prevent human-wildlife conflicts
- Supports conservation efforts for endangered species
- Provides a scalable model for wildlife management

## Project Cost

Total hardware cost: $133.57 - a cost-effective solution compared to alternatives

## Future Plans

- Implement LoRaWAN for expanded forest coverage
- Complete prototype deployment by end of 2025
